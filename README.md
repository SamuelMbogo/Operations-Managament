# Operations-Managament
First attempt at using Microsoft Project to solve a problem dished out as an assignment to a friend who's applying for a job.

You are tasked with completing a project based task and have to launch a location. You have to put the activities below 
in a logical order and present them in a simple Gantt Chart and then answer the questions below the table. You will only
be able to get the correct answers by creating a Gantt chart and reviewing the conditions of each activity carefully and to
take note of the overall starting rule above the table.
NOTE (STARTING RULE):
The launch date has to be on the first day of the first week of October 2021. Every day in this starting week has to
be in October
